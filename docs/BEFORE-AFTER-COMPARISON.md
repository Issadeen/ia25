  Opening Balance: $0
  Payments Received: $100,000
  Payments Applied: $99,824

Discrepancies: Multiple small balances - customer angry
Reconciliation: 4+ hours of manual investigation
Outcome: Gave customer credit to settle
Cost: Lost trust + staff time
```

  Payments Received: $100,000
  Payments Applied: $99,824

Discrepancies: None - all explained
Reconciliation: Automatic, 5 minutes
Outcome: Customer sees credit in Available Balance
Cost: Improved trust + zero staff time
```

## Technical Comparison

### Code Changes Required

#### Before
```
When overpayment occurs:
- Balance calculated: totalDue - totalAllocated
- If balance negative: Ignore or zero out
- No special handling
- No tracking
```

#### After
```
When overpayment occurs:
- Balance calculated: totalDue - totalAllocated
- If balance negative: Keep as is!
- Create owner_credits entry
- Add balance_usage deposit entry
- Update Available Balance
- Full tracking maintained
```

### Performance Impact

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Payment Processing | Fast | Same (no change) |
| UI Rendering | Fast | Same (added one listener) |
| Database Operations | N/A | Minimal (batch writes) |
| Storage Used | Low | Very low (few credits) |
| Query Performance | Fast | Fast (simple queries) |

---

## Migration from Before to After

### No Data Migration Needed!

```
Why?
1. Existing prepayments continue to work
2. New credits are independent
3. Available Balance combines both
4. No breaking changes
5. Can deploy immediately

Process:
1. Deploy code changes
2. Old prepayments still visible
3. New overpayments create credits
4. System works with both
5. Done!
