# 🎯 Overpayment Credit System - Feature Complete

## What This Feature Does

When a customer overpays on a truck order, the system now:
- ✅ **Detects** the overpayment automatically
- ✅ **Creates** a credit record in the database
- ✅ **Adds** it to their Available Balance
- ✅ **Displays** it clearly (blue, labeled "Credit")
- ✅ **Tracks** every transaction in audit logs
- ✅ **Allows** them to use the credit on future payments

## Quick Start - What Changed For You

### For End Users (Customers/Owners)

**Before**: When you overpaid, the credit disappeared 👎

**After**: 
1. Overpayment is tracked as a "Credit" 
2. Shows up in "Available Balance"
3. You can use it for next payment ✅

### For Finance/Accounting

**Before**: Missing overpayments, no audit trail 😕

**After**:
1. All credits recorded in database
2. Complete audit trail maintained
3. Available Balance is accurate ✅
4. Easy reconciliation with customers

### For Support Team

## Visual Examples

### Dashboard Changes

#### Financial Summary Card
```
BEFORE:
  Available Balance: $0.00 ❌ (where's my credit?)

AFTER:
  Available Balance: $179.39 ✅
  Includes $179.39 credits 💡
```

#### Truck Status
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Payment Made
```
Truck Order: $23,508.61
Customer Pays: $23,688.00
Overpayment: $179.39 ← Detected!
```

### Step 2: Credit Created
```
owner_credits entry created:
  - Amount: $179.39
  - Truck: SSD808AC
  - Status: Available
  - Timestamp: [When paid]
```

### Step 3: Available Balance Updated
```
Available Balance now shows: $179.39
Instead of: $0.00
```

### Step 4: Can Use Credit
```
Next truck payment:
  Due: $50.00
  Available Balance: $179.39
  → Use $50 from available balance
  → Remaining: $129.39 ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

- [ ] **Overpay a Truck**
  - Truck: $100 due
  - Payment: $150
  - Expected: Balance shows -$50 (BLUE), Status "Credit"
  - Check: Available Balance increased by $50

- [ ] **Check Available Balance**
  - Expected: Shows prepayment + credits
  - Shows hint: "Includes $X credits"
  - Math correct: prepayment + credits = total

- [ ] **View Credit in Database**
  - Check: `owner_credits/{owner}` has entry
  - Check: `balance_usage/{owner}` has deposit entry
  - Verify: Timestamps and amounts match

- [ ] **Use Credit on Next Payment**
  - Allocate truck: $50 due
  - Use available balance: $50
  - Expected: Truck marked paid, credit decreased

- [ ] **Run Reconciliation Audit**
  - No errors should appear
  - All credits should be accounted for
  - Balance should match calculation

- [ ] **Financial Summary Display**
  - Total Due: Correct
  - Total Paid: Correct
  - Balance: Shows correctly (may be negative)

## Common Questions

### Q: What if the customer wants to refund the credit?
**A**: 
1. Can be applied to next payment (self-service)
2. Can be credited to prepayment manually
3. Or refunded directly - your choice

### Q: How long do credits last?
**A**: No automatic expiration, but can be marked "expired" if needed

### Q: Can I create a credit manually?
**A**: Yes - add to `owner_credits/{owner}` with proper audit entry

### Q: Will this affect existing prepayments?
**A**: No - they work independently. Available Balance combines both.

### Q: How do I see all credits for an owner?
**A**: In `owner_credits/{owner}` or "Available Balance" on owner page

### Q: What if there's a dispute?
**A**: Check `balance_usage` and `owner_credits` for full audit trail
