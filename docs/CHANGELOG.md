# Changelog - Overpayment Credit System

## Version 1.0 - January 2025

### ✨ New Features

#### Overpayment Detection & Credit Creation
- Automatic detection when payment > total due
- Credit records created in `owner_credits/{owner}`
- Credits immediately added to Available Balance
- Audit entries created for all credits

#### Credit Display & Management
- Negative balances displayed as `-$X.XX` in blue
- Truck status shows "Credit" for overpaid orders
- Available Balance shows combined total (prepayment + credits)
- Hint text displays credit breakdown

#### Credit Tracking
- New Firebase table: `owner_credits/{owner}`
- Tracks: truckId, amount, source, status, timestamp
- Full audit trail in `balance_usage` (type: "deposit")
- Credits can be marked: available, used, or expired

#### New API Function
- `getAvailableBalance(database, owner)` - Get total available funds
- Returns: { prepayment, credits, total }

### 🔄 Changed Behavior

#### Payment Status Updates
- `updatePaymentStatuses()` now creates credits on overpayment
- `syncTruckPaymentStatus()` now creates credits on overpayment
- Tolerance ($0.50) NOT applied to credits (only to underpayments)

#### Balance Calculation
- `getTruckAllocations()` allows negative balances
- Negative balances preserved (not zeroed out)
- Pending amount only for positive balances

#### Display Logic
- Balance display: Shows sign and magnitude
- Status: "Due" (red), "Pending" (orange), "Paid" (green), "Credit" (blue)
- Available Balance: Prepayment + Credits

### 📊 UI Improvements

#### Financial Summary Card
```
Before:
  Available Balance: $0.00

After:
  Available Balance: $179.39
  Includes $179.39 credits ← NEW
```

After:
  Balance        Status

  (BLUE TEXT)
```

#### Balance Cell Colors
- Positive balance: Red (amount owed)
- Zero balance: Green (paid)
- Negative balance: Blue (credit)

### 🗄️ Database Changes

#### New Table
```
owner_credits/{owner}/{id}
  truckId: string
  truckNumber: string
  amount: number
  timestamp: string
  source: "overpayment"
  status: "available" | "used" | "expired"
  note: string
```

#### Updated Table
```
balance_usage/{owner}/{id}
  type: "deposit" ← NEW (for credits)
  note: "Credit from overpayment" ← NEW
```

### 🐛 Fixes

- Lost overpayment credits are now tracked
- Negative balances no longer zeroed out
- Available Balance now includes all resources
- Clear status indicators for different balance types

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. Credits don't automatically expire (manual management possible)
2. No automatic credit application to future orders yet
3. No max credit limit enforcement yet
4. Requires manual reconciliation if needed

### 🧪 Testing

Recommended test scenarios:
```
1. Overpay single truck
   → Verify credit created and Available Balance increased

2. Create multiple credits
   → Verify Available Balance sums correctly

3. Use credit on next payment
   → Verify credit deducted and payment applied

4. Mix cash + credit payment
   → Verify both applied correctly

5. Run reconciliation audit
   → Verify no discrepancies with credits
```
